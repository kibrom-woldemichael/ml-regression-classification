# Machine Learning Regression & Classification Analysis

This project explores regression and classification techniques using real-world datasets.
The focus is on data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison,
and evaluation.

## Datasets
- California Housing dataset (regression)
- Titanic dataset (classification)

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Models: Linear Regression, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, R², Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Random Forest models achieved the strongest overall performance across both regression
and classification tasks.

## How to run
Open the notebooks and run cells from top to bottom.
